# Introduction

AuditorySignalUtils.jl is a Julia package that impelments many of the types of signal processing primitives commonly used in psychoacoustics.
For example, using AuditorySignalUtils, it is easy to synthesize combinations of tones, set them at particular levels in terms of dB SPL, and add an on/off ramp. 
This is the documentation for AuditorySignalUtils.jl, and here you can learn about how to use the package and access information about details of the underlying code.
Presently, AuditorySignalUtils only provides a handful of functions, but more will be added over time if I continue to do auditory work in Julia!
